MetaIO
======

MetaIO provides a straightforward file format for storing N-Dimensional image
data as well as common "spatial" objects: tubes. ellipses, meshes, etc.

MetaIO documentation is available online at:
   http://www.itk.org/Wiki/MetaIO

The concepts and applications of SpatialObjects are presented in the ITK Software Guide:
   https://itk.org/ITK/help/documentation.html

This file exists in the central repository for MetaIO.

Installation
------------

The Git repositories for ITK (www.itk.org) and VTK (www.vtk.org) include
Git subtrees of this repository so they share a common MetaIO implementation.

To allow ITK and VTK to be compiled together, without duplication of
symbols from MetaIO, a local configuration file must also be installed
one level above the MetaIO src directory in each repository.

Stand-alone
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

  The stand-alone version of MetaIO uses the same configuration
  (namespace and config files) as the ITK version of MetaIO, so it is not
  possible for the stand-alone version of MetaIO to be installed with a full
  version of ITK.

1) Configure as you would any other project that is configured using cmake.
    e.g., create a new directory called MetaIO-build. Then, from within
    cmake, set MetaIO as the source directory and MetaIO-build as the binary
    directory, press configure, and then press go.
2) Build using any "modern" compiler
